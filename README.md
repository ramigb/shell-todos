# **ToDo**
### A very simple todo list app for the terminal


<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">
PLEASE NOTE, THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS</span>

## Why?
Well, other than the usual why not, it's because I was bored one afternoon without a lot to do so I've created it!.

## How?
You can always use --help to see what it does but here we go.

#### Setup
1. run **git clone** then cd into cloned folder
2. run **npm install**
3. That's it now you can run the below commands

NOTE: you can add the project folder to your PATH variable like so you can run todo from anywhere e.g.

    export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH

or simply run **./todo** inside the cloned folder

#### Commands

New Todo

    todo "todo text"

Done Todo

    todo done ID

Delete Todo

    todo delete ID

Wipe todos

    todo wipe

List todo

    todo list

Save todo to a text file

    todo > todos.txt
